# Translate

This Repo consist of Language Translation using two programming languages i.e. Python and Js(it works only on google chrome though!) .


## JavaScript

This one is very simple to run by just running the HTML file in the Chrome browser


## Python

This uses tornado to set up a amateur Tornado API(Not sure as to whether it follows RESTful principles!!)
